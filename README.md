Repository for "ZUPT aided GNSS Factor Graph with Inertial Navigation Integration for Wheeled Robots"

This work presents GNSS/WO/INS fusion strategies with a factor graph by exploiting the zero velocity information to improvethe positioning solution for wheeled robots. The presented methods are compared with a standard GNSS factor graph.
